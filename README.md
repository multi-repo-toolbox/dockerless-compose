# dockerless-compose

*Experimental. In dev. Not ready.*

Run multiple applications in once like docker-compose does but without docker or any containers.

# Roadmap

1. Proof of concept: run apps in a group with a minimal yaml-config.
2. All the options: fs-watchers, rebuilds, toml-config compatibli with yaml.
3. Docker-compose like: use docker images additionally to standalone binaries.
